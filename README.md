# BUS316-Final-Project

## Project Prompt
Write a one page summarizing your work - can be in Word. Your code will need to be in a good shape. There are no directions to spacing, indentation for the summary. The idea is that if you were involved in the project enough, you will need all the space you can get to explain yourself. Upload the code and the write up on your website or on github. You only need to submit a link to the where the write up and the code are.

Here are the guidelines to design the report:

1. What is your central research question? How will your work contribute to the problem that you have defined?

2. Explain in short the way you handled the solution. You may want to include something you struggled with and managed to solve.

3. Display and explain your results.
