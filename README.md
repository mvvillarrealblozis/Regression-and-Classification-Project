# BUS316-Final-Project

## Project Prompt
Write a one page summarizing your work - can be in Word. Your code will need to be in a good shape. There are no directions to spacing, indentation for the summary. The idea is that if you were involved in the project enough, you will need all the space you can get to explain yourself. Upload the code and the write up on your website or on github. You only need to submit a link to the where the write up and the code are.

Here are the guidelines to design the report:

1. What is your central research question? How will your work contribute to the problem that you have defined?

2. Explain in short the way you handled the solution. You may want to include something you struggled with and managed to solve.

3. Display and explain your results.

### Dataset Used
Walmart

This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Its nine supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions. Because this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced with “retailer”.

This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row corresponds to a customer review, and includes the variables:

Clothing ID: Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.
Age: Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.
Title: String variable for the title of the review.
Review Text: String variable for the review body.
Rating: Positive Ordinal Integer variable for the product score granted by the customer from 1 Worst, to 5 Best.
Recommended IND: Binary variable stating where the customer recommends the product where 1 is recommended, 0 is not recommended.
Positive Feedback Count: Positive Integer documenting the number of other customers who found this review positive.
Division Name: Categorical name of the product high level division.
Department Name: Categorical name of the product department name.
Class Name: Categorical name of the product class name

Does Age, Rating, Department Name, Class Name have connection to the Recommended IND column? Do they have a connection with the Positive Feedback Count column?

You will have to conduct Classification to answer the first question and Regression to answer the second.
